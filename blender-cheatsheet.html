Blender For Dummies Cheat Sheet

From Blender For Dummies, 3rd Edition

By Jason van Gumster

When it comes to Blender, you can save time in many ways. Memorizing common mouse actions and numeric keypad hotkeys in Blender or common keyboard hotkeys in Blender’s 3D View help you work more efficiently in Blender. If memorization isn’t your thing, you can even print lists of these mouse actions and hotkeys and refer to them whenever you need to.
Common Mouse Actions in Blender

Blender makes it a point to use as many buttons on your mouse as possible. You have five fingers; you may as well get full use of them. This table gives you some of the most commonly used mouse behaviors.
Action 	Result 	
Left-click 	Place 3D cursor 	
Ctrl+left-click (edit mode) 	Quick-extrude 	
Ctrl+left-click+drag 	Lasso selection 	
Right-click 	Select 	
Shift+right-click 	Add to selection 	
Alt+right-click (edit mode) 	Edge/Face loop select 	
Middle-click+drag 	Rotate view 	
Shift+middle-click+drag 	Pan view 	
Ctrl+middle-click+drag 	Zoom view 	
Common Numeric Keypad Hotkeys in Blender

The numeric keypad gives you a high-speed means of navigating the 3D View in Blender. The following table explains some of the more useful and common hotkeys that involve the numeric keypad. (Note: If you’re using a laptop that doesn’t have a numeric keypad, you can enable the Emulate Numpad check box in the Input section of User Preferences and use the numbers along the top of your keyboard instead of the numeric keypad.)

Common Keyboard Hotkeys in Blender’s 3D View

Blender is designed to be used with one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse. Nearly every key on a standard keyboard is assigned to some task within Blender, and sometimes more than one task. For example, the numbers across the top of the keyboard reveal each of the first ten Blender layers. Alt+Any number shows each of the last ten layers. Shift+Any number allows you to show more multiple layers simultaneously. And that’s not all! The following table shows some of the more commonly used hotkeys while working in Blender.
