There are two issues in the question that prevent you from the goal you want to achieve:

1. X server is missed in the image.

2. VNC server should be started in a container.

The additional part of Dockerfile is:

RUN apt-get install -y x11vnc xvfb 
RUN mkdir ~/.vnc
RUN x11vnc -storepasswd 1234 ~/.vnc/passwd
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

where entrypoint.sh is:

#!/bin/bash
x11vnc -forever -usepw -create &
/bin/bash

Now we can start a container using the following command:

docker run --rm -ti -p 5900:5900 < image_name_or_id >

and access it via vncviewer from the same host where container is started:

vncviewer localhost:5900
